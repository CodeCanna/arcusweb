      <h3>This is a heading</h3>
      <p>Example copy here will fill most of the space on the page. The demo in the docs atm is so narrow, it's always in mobile mode so I removed the responsive style suggestion in the code box above.</p>

      <h3>This is a heading</h3>
      <p>Example copy here will fill most of the space on the page. Flexbox enables the layout changes and is pretty great. Further copy and such to fill some room.</p>
      <p>I've put a horizontal rule in to help show that the content here is going all the way across.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="side-box">
      <h4 class="side-box-title">Side Box Title</h4>
      <p>This is content in the side box. It can continue on and will wrap, maxing the width out at 360px.</p>
      <p>There's even as much height as needed for the content!</p>
