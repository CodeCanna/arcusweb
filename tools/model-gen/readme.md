# Model Generator
Each object in the ARCUS system has an XML definition that defines the properties it has, the types
of those properties, and the methods that can be executed on that object.  The model generator
in the `i2web` repository is used to generate JavaScript objects for each of the *Capability*, *Service*,
and *Type* offered by ARCUS.

The main purpose of these generated JS objects is to communicate with the ARCUS platform in consistent
way.

### Installation
The model generator for the web front-end is a simple NodeJS executable, therefore it can be installed
simply by executing `npm install` in the source directory of the model generator.

For example:
```
$ cd ~/Projects/i2web/tools/model-gen
$ npm install
```

### Usage
The execution of the model generator makes the assumption that the following directories exist:
* `<i2common repo>/iris2-model/src/main/resources/[capability|service|type]`
* `<i2web repo>/src/models/[capability|service|type]`

The structure of the command is as follows:
`<i2web repo>/tools/<generator exe> <i2common repo> <i2web repo>`

For example, given a `i2web` repository located at `/Users/usershomedir/Projects/i2web` and
the `i2common` repository is located at `/Users/usershomedir/Projects/i2common`, a user can
regenerate the models by executing the following command:

`~/Projects/i2web/tools/model-gen/bin/cli.js ~/Projects/i2common ~/Projects/i2web`

The files generated by the model generator are located within the following directories:
* `<i2web repo>/src/models/capability`
* `<i2web repo>/src/models/service`
* `<i2web repo>/src/models/type`
